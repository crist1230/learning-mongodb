Insert Operations: 
    db.collection.insert()
        not recommended. can take one({}) or many({}, {}, {})
    db.collection.insertOne()
        can only take one ({})
    db.collection.insertMany()
        takes many as an array ([{}, {}, {}])

Option:
    db.collection.insertMany([{}, {}, {}], {ordered: false})
        - if one document is "corrupt" the code will still run and insert "uncorrupted" documents
        - default is {ordered: true} if it encounters one "corrupted" doc, it won't check the docs after it and ends the program

Atomicity:
    - mongodb is automic on the document level
    - if you insert a doc and one of the fields (say "hobbies") fails, but "name" and "age" didn't have any problems, the doc
      doesn't get saved as a whole

Importing Data:
    mongoimport *file* -d *database* -c *collection* --*data type* --drop
        -d: creates db on the fly
        -c: creates collection
        --*data type*: ex - jsonArray
        --drop: drops the collection if it already exists and replaces it with data
                default is to just append new data to the existing collection
