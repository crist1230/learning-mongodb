- there are 2 things you can do when you structure data...
    1. nest the documents:
        {
            userName: 'Cristiana',
            age: 12,
            address: {
                street: 'Magnolia Street',
                city: 'Issaquah'
            }
        }
    2. reference other documents:
        {
            userName: 'Cristiana',
            favBooks: ['id1', 'id2']
        }
        {
            _id: 'id1',
            name: 'The Westing Game'
        }

- for one-to-one relationships, you'll likely want to go with #1
    ex: each person has their own medical history, no one else in a hospital will have the same medical history
